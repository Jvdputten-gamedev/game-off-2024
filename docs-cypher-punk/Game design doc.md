# Summary
**A mysterious top-down archive exploration game where players must decipher a hidden language to uncover secrets and progress through the interconnected spaces, using their growing knowledge to speedrun through increasingly complex puzzle rooms.**

You find yourself in the vast, shadowy halls of an ancient archive, its corridors lined with shelves and tomes of forgotten knowledge. As a living shade, your goal is to navigate these labyrinthine spaces and uncover the secrets they hold. The archive itself serves as the primary puzzle, with text and symbols covering the floors, walls, and objects around you. By carefully observing and deciphering this mysterious language, you'll slowly piece together the actions and pathways needed to progress deeper into the archive.

Each room presents a new challenge, requiring you to apply your growing understanding of the language system. Some doors may demand a specific sequence of actions, while others hide passages that can only be revealed by translating more complex phrases. As you speedrun through the archive, your knowledge compounds - what was once incomprehensible text becomes the key to shortcuts and new areas. The archive constantly shifts, leaving you to rely on your wits and reflexes to reach the most closely guarded secrets before they vanish from sight.

# Core

The core loop revolves around exploring the archive, deciphering the hidden language, and using that knowledge to progress deeper into the interconnected spaces.

1. Exploration:
    - The player navigates the shadowy, top-down environment of the archive
    - They carefully examine the rooms, walls, and objects for clues and translations
    - Certain paths may be blocked, requiring the player to backtrack or find alternative routes
2. Language Deciphering:
    - The player collects individual word translations by finding them scattered throughout the archive
    - They use these translations to start piecing together the meaning of more complex phrases and symbols
    - Discovering new words or realizing a symbol has multiple contextual meanings provides "aha!" moments
3. Applying Knowledge:
    - With their growing understanding of the language, the player can now interact with previously impenetrable areas
    - Solving room-based puzzles by translating the text on doors or objects allows them to advance
    - Finding shortcuts or alternate paths becomes possible as the player masters the language system
4. Speedrunning:
    - Knowledge carries over between runs, allowing the player to optimize their route
    - The archive's layout and puzzle sequences change, forcing the player to adapt their strategies
    - Mastering the language system and movement abilities is key to achieving faster clear times

This loop of exploration, translation, and application creates a compelling cycle of discovery and progression. As the player's mastery increases, they can tackle more complex challenges and reveal additional layers of the archive's secrets.

The limited color palette and ambient, atmospheric presentation heighten the sense of mystery, with the player's character glowing amidst the shadowy environment. Solving each puzzle feels deeply rewarding as it unlocks new areas and expands the player's understanding of this enigmatic world.
